LCCRF
=====

A C++ implementation of Linear Chain Conditional Random Field. 

This implementation aims to have:

* Readability. It follows the math derivation as consistent as possible to be comprehensive.
* Pureness. The core algorithm(LCCRF) itself is strictly seperated with other distracting purposes of the various kind of applications.
